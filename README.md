# star fwd software integration on RCF
This code provides a snapshot of the star-sw development of the STAR forward tracking and detector simulator software.

## TL;DR.
1) checkout the github repo : `git clone https://github.com/jdbrice/star-fwd-integration.git`
2) run `starver dev`, then run `./rcf-build.sh` to build the code
3) make a simulation dataset : `starsim -w 0 -b tests/testg.kumac nevents=1000 ntrack=1 etamn=2.5 etamx=4.0 ptmn=0.2 ptmx=1.0`
4) run the forward tracking test with : `source rcf-env.sh` then `root4star -b -q -l tests/fast_track.C`
5) Optional: check test.root for the debug output of the forward tracking, e.g. "PtRes" histogram shows average pT resolution.

### StFwdTrackMaker
This is the main package for running forward tracking through StRoot. The package consists of a "maker" that interfaces with the STAR environment and can be run as part of the `StChain`.  The `StFwdTrackMaker` and internal tracking framework maintain a clear separation of concerns. From the perspective of the `StFwdTrackMaker` the tracking package is meant to be a "black box" - space points from detector hits are fed into it, and track seeds / fit tracks are output and the internal implementation is irrelavent.  
#### What the `StFwdTrackMaker` does:
- `StFwdTrackMaker` loads detector hit data
  - directly from GEANT for MC level tracking performance
  - from the StEvent hit collections
- Provides primary vertex information (currently only MC PV information is provided)
- Writes track info into `StEvent`

#### What the tracking package does:
- Once, during initialization
  - loads magnetic field map from `StarMagField`
  - sets up geometry for tracking in material 
- Each event
  - finds track seeds
  - fits tracks using GenFit
  - passes back a list of fit tracks 
  

### StFstSimMaker
This package provides simulators for the forward silicon tracker. Currently only the "fast" simulator is included. The fast simulator processes GEANT hits stored in the `g2t_fsi_hit` table. The primary function of this package is to digitize the GEANT hits onto the R-phi strips of the silicon sensor layout. The hits are stored into `StRndHit` objects and the covariance matrix is computed according to the local geometry of the hit.

### StFttSimMaker
This package provides simulators for the forward silicon tracker. Currently only the "fast" simulator is included. The fast simulator processes GEANT hits stored in the `g2t_stg_hit` table. The primary function of this package is to digitize the GEANT hits onto the strip layout of the sTGC module geometry. The hits are stored into `StRndHit` objects and the covariance matrix is computed according to the nominal XY resolution of 100 microns. Since the sTGC is essentially a sandwich of two 1D detectors, ghost hits are present at the intersection of lit strips. These ghost hits are computed according to XY strips and added to the hit collection. 


### Note about Fast Simulators
Since the fast simulator is meant to be the simplest response simulator, they are essentially complete.
However a few things will change in the future:
- `StRndHit` will be replaced a dedicated hit object for `fst` type hits. 
- The `StRndHitCollection` will be replaced with a dedicated hit collection for `fst` type hits

These updates to `StEvent` are being worked on in parallel (the addition of dedicated hit types and collections). The important things to note are that 1) this code already works with the `StEvent` in `dev`, 2) `StEvent` can be updated separately with no conflicts, 3) The update will be atomic/transparent since no other code currently depends the `StRndHit` / `StRndHitCollection`.


## Building the packages on RCF
The file `build.sh` invokes cons with additional flags to provide header files for the external dependencies of Genfit and KiTrack.
Build with:
```sh
starver dev
./rcf-build.sh
```
This modified `cons` call just adds include paths via the `EXTRA_CPPPATH` variable. Currently the header files for the dependencies are found here:
```
/star/data03/pwg/jdb/FWD/cmake/star-install-SL20c-64-Release/sl74_x8664_gcc485/include/
```

## Running tests
### Generate simulation file as input 
A simple kumac is included for generating single particle events for testing.
generate an `fzd` file with:
```sh
starsim -w 0 -b tests/testg.kumac nevents=1000 ntrack=1 etamn=2.5 etamx=4.0 ptmn=0.2 ptmx=1.0
```

### Running the forward tracking

The fast_track.C script is a basic example of how to run the two fast simulators and the forward tracking package.
It can be run with:
```
source rcf-env.sh
root4star -b -q -l tests/fast_track.C
```
This will produce a number of output files for evaluating the fast simulators and the tracking.
Specifically one may look at "test.root" which contains the forward tracking output. 
The histogram "FitStatus" shows a summary of the fitting steps.
The histogram "PtRes" shows the pT resolution.


## Prebuilt dependencies
The `GenFit2` and `KiTrack` libraries are built with CMAKE. The prebuilt shared libraries are here:
```
/star/data03/pwg/jdb/FWD/cmake-test/star-install-SL20c-32-Release/sl74_gcc485/lib/
```
built in 32-bit release mode.



## NOTES:
As of this writing, the code builds on RCF but I do not have a setup for running the forward tracking yet - since I need to build Genfit and KiTrack in RCF (32bit).
